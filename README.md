# Stonks
Heyo! Stonks is a Python Finance Package I built to get more experience with Data Analysis and ML. As of right now, Stonks does the following:

1. Collects Stock Price Data in a Dataframe (last 100 Days, and All Time)
2. ESN Price Predictions
3. Prophet Price Predictions
4. Volatility
5. Portfolio Optimization
6. Market Cap

Features will still be added, and this project will be continually updated. The end goal is that it will eneventually serve as an extremely useful, beginner friendly Python Finance API to allow anyone to jump into Algo Trading or Quant Finance.
